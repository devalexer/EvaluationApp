        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>For many teachers/professors, the struggle to get practical feedback on lectures, lesson plans, 
        and student comprehension relies on delayed tests and spotty individual feeback. However, the opportunity 
        to recieve real-time tracking of student understanding offers a revolution for proactive lecturers. 
        EvaluApp allows students to indicated understanding via individual app interfaces with real-time tracking 
        and questions displayed to the lecturer on a graphing interface. </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p class="paragraphwrap">All too often, teachers will stare at a sea of blank faces to wondering if the concepts they are teaching are sinking in. Real-time tracking allows lecturers to maximize the amount of time spent on introducing or reinforcing material and less wasted time covering concepts already understood. EvaluApp provides a simple portal for organizing data on student comprehension of each individual lecture. In the beginning of a class, the teacher will send out a unique link for the class. After entering their name (for tracking and attendance purposes), the student encounters a simple interface with prominent up/down buttons and an area to enter questions. As the lecture progresses, students will click either up or down to indicate their understanding of the lecture material. This feedback will then be returned to the professor in a simple graph that charts the collective level of understanding. Student questions are also transmitted to their display. Particularly in large auditoriums or with shy students, educators will be able to easily understand what is happening in their class as they progress through the curriculum.</p>
